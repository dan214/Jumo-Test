## Assumptions

There are several assumptions that I've made in the course of building this project.

1. I've assumed the order of the columns on the Loans.csv will always remain the same.
2. I've also assumed the loans amount column will always have number values.
3. I've also assumed that the date format column will always a correct date format.
